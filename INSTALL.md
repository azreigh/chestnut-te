# Installing
Firstly, install [Brux](https://github.com/KelvinShadewing/brux-gdk/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for your specific platform.
On Linux, it is recommended to install brux to `/usr/bin/brux`.
Following this, install [Hazel](https://github.com/tulip-sudo/hazel). `Note: Hazel has only been tested on Linux and only works with Linux at this point in time.`
Next, you can either open the terminal and run `brux app.brx` or create a new mimetype and associate .brx files to it along with making the files open in brux.
